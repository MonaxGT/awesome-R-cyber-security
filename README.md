Awesome R cybersecurity collection
============================================

A collection of awesome R-language libraries, documents, books, resources and cool stuff.

## Libraries

### Threat Intelligence

- [VirusTotal](https://github.com/themains/virustotal) - R client for the Virustotal Public API. Virustotal is a Google service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses etc.

### Network Security 

- [anomalyDetection](https://github.com/koalaverse/anomalyDetection) - Implements procedures to aid in detecting network log anomalies. By combining various multivariate analytic approaches relevant to network anomaly detection, it provides cyber analysts efficient means to detect suspected anomalies requiring further evaluation.

### Main themes

- [net.security](https://github.com/r-net-tools/net.security) - This package provides functions for security standards data management. It comes with data frames of 1000 observations for each security standard and updates are possible from official sources to build updated data sets. 

- [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr) - The aim of httr is to provide a wrapper for the curl package, customised to the demands of modern web APIs.
